# Dry_bean_K-means
Dry Bean Classification using K-means Clustering

# Dataset:
The dataset, "Dry_Bean.csv," contains information about seven different types of dry beans, considering features such as form, shape, type, and structure. The dataset was used in a research project to develop a computer vision system for distinguishing between the registered varieties of dry beans.

# Files in the Repository
Dry_Bean.csv: The dataset used for the research. It includes information about the features of seven different types of dry beans.

kmeans_clustering_from_scratch.py:
Python script implementing K-means clustering from scratch. The script includes functions for initializing centroids, finding the closest centroids, computing centroids, and running the K-means algorithm. The results are visualized using matplotlib.

kmeans_clustering_sklearn.py:
Python script utilizing the scikit-learn library for K-means clustering. The script performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and then applies K-means clustering. The results are visualized using matplotlib.

## Results
The scripts will output visualizations showcasing the clustering results for the dry bean dataset.
In the both version, PCA is used to reduce the dimensions before applying K-means clustering.
